# R Style Guide for Financial Recipes

The purpose of this document is to define a consistent style-guide for our R
code. Automatic tools may be employed to encourage the use of this style.

A good coding style is like a good writing style â€” it is good if it is easy for
the target audience to read. The target audience are:

1. **The intended readers of Financial Recipes**.
2. The writers of Financial Recipes.
3. The future maintainers of Financial Recipes.

The emphasis is on the readers of Financial Recipes, as this is our primary
audience. A style guide helps a reader along by encouraging a consistent writer
style. Granted, this style may not suit the artistry of the writer, and in
select, well-founded cases, the writer *can* deviate from these requirements.
Consider fixing the style guide instead.

Furthermore, this style guide is likely to be incomplete.

As such, this style guide is written by the people, for the people, and while
suggestions for improvements are always welcome, please avoid
[bike-shedding](http://bikeshed.com/) the conversation.

## Inspiration

What readers of Financial Recipes might expect of our R code:

  2. [Advanced R Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
  3. [MSU, ZOL851 R Style Guide](https://www.msu.edu/~idworkin/ZOL851_style_guide.html).

An additional source of inspiration is the

## Line Length

Avoid long lines. Long lines are hard to wrap your head around. A good rule of
thumb is roughly 80 (monospaced) characters. See below for when to break your
lines.

## Indentation

Indent your code to make its structure visually apparent at first glance.

Use 2 spaces for indentation (tab defaults to 2 spaces in Jupyter).

## Spacing

Space out your code to make it feel less "cramped".

Place spaces around binary operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.).

    # Good
    Btau <- (1 - exp(-kap * tau)) / kap

    # Bad
    Btau<-(1-exp(-kap*tau))/kap

Always place a space after a comma, but never before it.

    # Good
    array(1:3, c(2, 4))
    col1 <- sum(x[, 1])
    rowl <- sum(x[1, ])

    # Bad
    array(1:3,c(2,4))
    col1 <- sum(x[,1])
    row1 <- sum(x[ ,1])

Place a space before a left parenthesis, except if in connection with a function
call.

    # Good
    if (is.nan(x))

    # Bad
    if(is.nan(x))

    # Good
    for (x in 1:nQ)

    # Bad
    for(x in 1:nQ)

Add extra spacing to achieve more readable alignments.

    # Good
    plot(x    = x,
         y    = y,
         type = 'l',
         col  = "blue",
         ylim = c(0.7,1),
         xlab = "time",
         ylab = "price")

    # Bad
    plot(x, y, type = 'l', col = "blue", ylim = c(0.7,1), xlab = "time", ylab = "price")

# Curly Braces

An opening curly brace goes on the same line. Do not omit curly braces, they
are easy to forget if you add another line in the future.

    # Good
    if (opttype==1) {
        result <- spot * exp(-q * timetomat)
    }

    # Bad
    if (opttype==1) result <- exp(-q * timetomat) * pnorm(d1)

    # Bad
    if (opttype==1)
        result <- exp(-q * timetomat) * pnorm(d1)

    # Bad
    if (opttype==1)
    {
        result <- exp(-q * timetomat) * pnorm(d1)
    }

An `else` statement should always be surrounded by curly braces.

    # Good
    if (opttype==1) {
        result <- exp(-q * timetomat) * pnorm(d1)
    } else {
        result <- (spot ^ 2) * exp((r + sigma ^ 2) * timetomat)
    }

    # Bad
    if (condition) {
        one or more lines
    }
    else {
        one or more lines
    }

## Assignment

Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment.

    # Good
    x <- 5

    # Bad
    x = 5

## Function Definitions and Function Calls

A function definition should first list the argument without default values,
and then those with default values. Of what use is a default value which has to
be set?

If you need line breaks in your function definition or function call, break
them after commas, and indent until the opening brace.

    # Good
    BlackScholesFormula  <- function (spot, timetomat, strike, r, sigma,
                                      q = 0, opttype = 1, greektype = 1) {

    # Bad
    BlackScholesFormula  <- function (spot, timetomat, strike, r, q = 0, sigma, opttype = 1, greektype = 1) {

## File Organization

### Layout

1. Author comment
2. File description comment
3. Function definitions
4. Executed statements (e.g. `plot`)
