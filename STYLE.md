# R Style Guide for Financial Recipes

The purpose of this document is to define a consistent style-guide for our R
code. Automatic tools may be employed to encourage the use of this style.

A good coding style is like a good writing style â€” it is good if it is easy for
the target audience to read. The target audience are:

1. **The intended readers of Financial Recipes**.
2. The writers of Financial Recipes.
3. The future maintainers of Financial Recipes.

The emphasis is on the readers of Financial Recipes, as this is our primary
audience. A style guide helps a reader along by encouraging a consistent writer
style when it comes to R code. Granted, this style may not suit the artistry of
the writer, and in select, well-founded cases, the writer *can* deviate from
these requirements. It may perhaps even be worth-while to fix the style guide
instead.

As such, this style guide is written by the people, for the people, and while
suggestions for improvements are always welcome, please avoid
[bike-shedding](http://bikeshed.com/) the conversation.
